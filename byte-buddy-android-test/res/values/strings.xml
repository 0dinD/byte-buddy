        This application creates several subclasses using Byte Buddy and loads these classes using Byte Buddy\'s
        class loading strategy for Android. For this to work, one needs to manually add the Android SDK\'s dex
        compiler \'dex.jar\' before deploying this application. Because of the SDK\'s license agreement, it is not
        permitted to distribute this dex compiler outside of the SDK. It is the responsibility of the user of this
        application to fulfill this license agreement.
    </string>
    <string name="no_dx_jar">
        It seems like the required \'dx.jar\' was not added to the application. Please redeploy this application
        after adding this jar file.
